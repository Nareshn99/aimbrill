# MERN Stack Assignment

This project is an assignment to demonstrate the ability to build a full-stack application using the MERN stack.

## Technologies

The MERN stack is a combination of the following technologies:

- **M**ongoDB: A document-based NoSQL database used to store our application data
- **E**xpress: A web application framework for Node.js
- **R**eact: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **N**ode.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing code on the server

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You will also need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project, and add the following environment variables:

```
PORT=3333
MONGO_URL=<your_mongo_url>
SECRET=<your_secret>
```

Once these steps are complete, you can start the server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

.

Thank you!
